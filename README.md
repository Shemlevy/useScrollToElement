# use-scroll-to-element

> âœ¨ Scroll to an element gives the ability to scroll to any element in the app from a place far ahead 
>    without knowing on the Component anything (if it has been rendered or not)

> useScrollToElement HOOK - a tiny hook that useLayoutEffect, ensuring the element is on Dom.
> let you the ability to dispatch an action before the component has rendered and the scroll will happen right after it appears.

#Getting started
    import { ScrollToElement } from "use-scroll-to-element";
    
    export const {
        useScroll: useScrollToBottom,
        scroll: scrollToBottom
    } = new ScrollToElement();



* ScrollToElement can apply just on "real" elements that is on the DOM - will not work on virtual lists etc.
* @scroll - promise function once solved will scroll to the element by the id was generated from useScroll.
* @useScroll - should be placed in the Component element, returning the id to attach to the desired scrolled element.

        @return   {Object}   
        object with scroll and useScroll
